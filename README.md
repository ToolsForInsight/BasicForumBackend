This short project, part of the Udacity Full Stack Developer Nanodegree, is a basic backend for an internet forum.

The database that supports the backend is PostgreSQL.

The code that wraps the database queries is written in Python.

The first commit is the code as received from Udacity, with no database connectivity.  The other commits create the backend for the forum and protect against SQL attacks.
